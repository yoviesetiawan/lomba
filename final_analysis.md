### ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Vote Counting Display Issue
**Status**: Partially Identified
**Problem**: Vote counts showing 0 for all participants
**Analysis**: 
- Google Apps Script is responding correctly with JSON: `{"success":true,"votes":{},"totalVotes":0}`
- The issue is that the "Suara Favorit" sheet in Google Sheets appears to be empty
- The script is working but there's no vote data to display
- This suggests either:
  - No votes have been cast yet
  - The voting functionality needs to be tested with actual votes
  - There might be a data synchronization issue between voting and storage
